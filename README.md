# Learning Disentangled Representations Workshop @ NIPS 2017 - Unofficial workshop book (consisting of accepted papers)

Taken from the official workshop website - https://sites.google.com/view/disentanglenips2017

## Contents of the Repo

- `script.py` - script to extract accepted papers whose PDF is available and join them into a book and save it. :)
- `disentangled_nips17_workshop_book.pdf` - the workshop book combining the accepted papers.

**If this was useful, you can modify the script to generate similarly for other sites (depends). I have done it on 2 other workshops which I was interested in reading end2end**
